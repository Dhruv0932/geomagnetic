# Predicting Geomagnetic Storms: Interactive Report and Notebooks

## Overview

This repository contains an interactive web report and supporting Jupyter notebooks for the thesis **"Predicting Geomagnetic Storms"** by Dhruv Sharma (University of Otago, 2025). The work focuses on forecasting geomagnetic storms using machine learning models applied to local K-index data from New Zealand’s Eyrewell Geomagnetic Observatory.

## Repository Contents

- `index.html`   
  An interactive, single-page web report that includes:
  - Data exploration visualizations
  - Model comparison dashboard (Model Showdown)
  - Probabilistic forecasting section
  - Key findings and recommendations

- `EDA.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis, including visualization of K-index and magnetic field data.

- `ModellingusingKvaluesandMFdata.ipynb`  
  Notebook for modeling using both K-index values and magnetic field features.

## Technologies Used

- **Chart.js**: For generating interactive charts and visualizations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**: For typography.
- **Jupyter / Python (notebooks)**: For data exploration and modeling, using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`.

## Notes

- All visualizations in the report are static or simulated; no external APIs are called at runtime.
- The notebooks should be run in a Jupyter environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
